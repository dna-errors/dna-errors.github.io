title: Eight Horses Paradox

# Eight Horsers Paradox

**What force produce 8 horses pulling as a single team?** - such a question in some kids book on basics of
physics astonished me greatly.

Author explained, that in situations when multiple horses are joined to pull some heavy load together, their
total pulling force doesn't increase properly (linearly) with the number. He produced some table, supposedly
calculated as a result of some real trials, looking like this:

- 2 horses produce total force of 1.9 times compared to single horse
- 3 produce only 2.6 times
- 4 give just 3.1 (so one horse is almost "waste")
- 5 yield 3.5 (one and half horses lost!)
- 6, 7 and 8 horses barely increase this value (3.7, 3.8, 3.8 correspondingly)

This is explained by horses not pulling synchronously enough and even hindering each other efforts.

**And this works in IT projects too!** Let's have a look at some negative as well as some positive examples.

<h2 class="section-heading">Seven men plus some experts</h2>

The project with codename "MP" was at very "conception" state when I joined the team. They all were very nice,
positive fellows and posed themselves as "Startup". Despite such early stage, I was already 7-th in the core
team, and there were more part-time specialists besides this core.

Pretty little army! But half a year later I started to feel that we only achieved as much as a pair smart students
can do in a month. Half a year more - and the startup still had failed to "start".

There were several factors leading to such a sad situation, the team size (and professional level) - one of the critical ones. [**Read more...**](mp-heads.html)

<h2 class="section-heading">Hard win with 150 heads</h2>

Very different, but also nearly-disastrous experience from the "MO" project. It evolved like this:

- client had great but extremely puzzling task
- and wanted quick result (in half a year)
- then 150 people were allocated to it in hope to do it quickly

It was not complete disaster, since there was some work done anyway, but feel free to [**Read more**](mo-150.html)
in the dedicated article.

<h2 class="section-heading">Positive Cases</h2>

**Microsoft** was started by just two fellows, **Bill Gates** and **Paul Allen**. Of course their first project
was somewhat smaller, but it is worth studying. They learnt that MITS is producing curious and comparatively
small computer "Altair 8800", lacking user-friendly software. Gates contacted MITS claiming they already work
on implementation of BASIC interpreter for this machine. Thus he made sure product can potentially be sold
before it was actually started.

However it is important that while Gates had obvious business skills, he actively participated in development.
Guys cleverly split the work - Paul created emulator of the Altair (they have no real machine) while Gates
worked on interpreter itself (supposedly acquiring and adapting some different version).

The thing was completed in a few weeks. MITS agreed to distribute it. Revenues after year and half totalled
to `$16000` (multiply perhaps by `10` for inflation). Picture of Microsoft staff in two more years shows `11` persons.

Similarly **Apple Inc** was started by two friends, **Steve Jobs** and **Steve Wozniak** who conceived idea of
small home computer, "Apple I". It is in many ways different, particularly because member roles were quit
distinct - Steve W. was hardware guru, while Steve J. besides excellent business and management skills was
always influential in shaping out requirements for company products.

<h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

One of "Parkinson's Laws" states that "boss on every level tends to increase the number of subordinates" - so
most probably this situation goes beyond the IT-world.

The good idea is to start with 2-3 people able to produce some Proof-of-Concept solution. If you feel that team
is already larger but Minimum-Value-Product is yet in unforeseeable future - most probably things already have
diverted from the right way - take urgent actions immediately!
